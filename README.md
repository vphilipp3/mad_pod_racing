### Next steps

- Have a better interception algorithm (currently not working that good on tight circuits).
- Try to fix the "slow" moments of the racer
- Have the racer put up the SHIELD when it's gonna be hit hard off course
- Have the defender BOOST and SHIELD when hitting an opponent off course
